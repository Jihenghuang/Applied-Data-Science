# Applied-Data-Science
This developing repository contains the teaching materials for my CUSP course on applied data science. They are written in either R script 
or Python 3.X contained in Jupyter notebooks. I've done my best to ensure the syntax still works, especially for the Bayesian lecture.  

May 15, 2017 Update: Yahoo Finance has either altered or discontinued its API functionality.  

June 12, 2017 Update: I've added older R materials on neural networks and other classifiers, includgin XGBoost and tsne.  Unfortunately, 
MXNET has not been compiled for R 3.2.2, so that API does not currently work.  I will aim to develop a Juptyer notebook in Python to 
address neural networks and other classifiers.

Feel free to use and adapt.
