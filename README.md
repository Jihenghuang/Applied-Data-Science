# Applied-Data-Science
This developing repository contains the teaching materials for my CUSP course on applied data science. 
They are written in Python 3.X contained in Jupyter notebooks. 
I've done my best to ensure the syntax still works, especially for the Bayesian lecture.
Feel free to use and adapt.
